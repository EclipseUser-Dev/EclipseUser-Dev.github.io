# No-Hello

Don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat. Don’t call someone out of the blue. Instead, phrase a message that allows your chat partners to provide a meaningful response as soon as they allocate time to read and answer your message.

Here are some tips for effective chat communication:
- Keep your messages short and to the point.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize your thoughts.
- Use bold or italic text to emphasize important points.
- Use headings to break up long messages into sections.
- Use code blocks for code snippets or long quotes.
- Use links to provide additional information or context.

By following these tips, you can help ensure that your chat conversations are productive and efficient.
